Figuring out authenticity of news is crucial before making decisions that can affect people around us. Due to technological advancement, people can be made more convinient by having a tool that automates detection of fake news and this sort of automation can be achieved using machine learning and text mining. Therefore, this project has been initiated to use news data for authenticity prediction as either REAL or FAKE
